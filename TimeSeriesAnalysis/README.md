# Description 
Hello, reader. Forecasted about three years of sulfur emissions (split into four quarters). We will look into forecasting future sulfur emissions. In total, this data is crucial to study due to future levels of emissions. If these levels are projected to worsen, then we should be mindful of that. -Built various models through SAS programming: Classical Decomposition, ARMA modeling. -Tested to discover the best model with: shapiro-wilk testing, white noise probability, holt winters exponential smoothing, QQ plot, as well as calculated SSE values.


# Navigation through this 

### Code - with Junta.
### Sulfur Emissions pptx - the finalized powerpoint.
### Stat 343_Time Series Final project - the writing sample.


# Order of Operations to run this code

Code is stored with Junta Callahan.
 
 ### Motivation 
 
The motivation for this project was to solve climate change biases!
  
 ### Architecting 

We completed this project to earn a good grade. We earned 100/100.

### Purpose

Efficiently completes the project. We did this one in record time. Junta led the coding efforts.

### Lessons Learned

Seasonality, SAS analysis, and how to apply these data driven problem to a real world problem.

### Uniqueness

Junta and I put together a solid project, that became applicable.

### Additional Features

We presented this pretty well, and covered the whole topic.

# Description 
Greetings, esteemed reader. This analysis pertains to the forecasting of sulfur emissions over a three-year period, divided into four quarters. Our objective is to accurately predict future levels of sulfur emissions, as they are a crucial factor in determining the future impact on the environment. By constructing multiple models through SAS programming, including Classical Decomposition and ARMA modeling, we have thoroughly evaluated the best model through a variety of statistical tests such as Shapiro-Wilk testing, White Noise Probability, Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing, QQ Plot, and calculation of Sum of Squared Error values.

 ### Motivation 
 
 The driving force behind this project was to address the issue of biases associated with climate change, and to seek solutions to mitigate their impact. The aim was to not only to enhance our understanding of the topic, but also to contribute to the larger effort of finding sustainable and effective ways to tackle the challenge of climate change. The project was based on extensive research, analysis and data-driven approaches, with the ultimate goal of providing actionable insights and recommendations that could be implemented in the real world.
  
 ### Architecting and Purpose
 
This project was undertaken with the purpose of tackling the problem of biases in relation to climate change. The objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and contribute to the global effort of finding viable solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change. The project was methodically planned, incorporating comprehensive research, in-depth analysis, and data-driven strategies. The end goal was to offer practical insights and suggestions that could be effectively executed in the real world.

### Lessons Learned

Seasonality, SAS analysis, and how to apply these data driven problem to a real world problem.

### Uniqueness

Junta and I put together a solid project, that became applicable.

### Additional Features

We presented this pretty well, and covered the whole topic.

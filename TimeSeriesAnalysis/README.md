# Description 
Greetings, esteemed reader. This analysis pertains to the forecasting of sulfur emissions over a three-year period, divided into four quarters. Our objective is to accurately predict future levels of sulfur emissions, as they are a crucial factor in determining the future impact on the environment. By constructing multiple models through SAS programming, including Classical Decomposition and ARMA modeling, we have thoroughly evaluated the best model through a variety of statistical tests such as Shapiro-Wilk testing, White Noise Probability, Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing, QQ Plot, and calculation of Sum of Squared Error values.


# Navigation through this 

### Code - with Junta.
### Sulfur Emissions pptx - the finalized powerpoint.

# Order of Operations to run this code

Code is stored with Junta Callahan.
 
 ### Motivation 
 
The motivation for this project was to solve climate change biases!
  
 ### Architecting 

We completed this project to earn a good grade. We earned 100/100.

### Purpose

Efficiently completes the project. We did this one in record time. Junta led the coding efforts.

### Lessons Learned

Seasonality, SAS analysis, and how to apply these data driven problem to a real world problem.

### Uniqueness

Junta and I put together a solid project, that became applicable.

### Additional Features

We presented this pretty well, and covered the whole topic.

# Description 

Hello, reader. This is the README and will serve as a great way to acess files that are utilized in project 1.

# Order of Operations to run this code
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
2. Copy and paste the file [compiled_code.py](https://github.com/EthanNorton/JHU.625.202/blob/proj1/compiled_code.py)
3. The code should then be functionable.
4. **Optional, check out the entire source code here:**
   a. [Entire Project 1](https://github.com/EthanNorton/JHU.625.202.git)
 
 ### Motivation 
  The motivation for this project was to build data structures and algorithms skills, as well as dive into the computer science realm! 
  
 ### Architecting 

I built this project in order to grow my knowledge of programming. Also, I hope to provide enhancements that will reduce coding pain of the JHU community.

### Purpose

Efficiently (as possible) converts prefix to postfix. Ideally, all prefix would have been convertable. This was not possible in this project :(

### Lessons Learned

Sometimes programming does not go as planned. Perserve through the bugs and try to nail the solution. Keep in mind that you are coding for a purpose greater than yourself.

### Uniqueness

I put all of my energy into my programming. I did my best, and almost always do my best in every project I attempt. This project is no exception. Where there are errors, I will attempt to resolve them.

### Additional Features

My analysis is pretty thoughtful, in my opinion.

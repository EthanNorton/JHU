# Description 
Hello, reader. This is the README and will serve as a great way to access files that are utilized in project 1.


# Navigation through this 
1. some_file.txt = the input that is received, with additional input from myself.
2. Main.py = the main file the uploads the input, and launches the rest of the project.
3. StackOfIntegers.py =  the file which loads the stacks for programming, and sets up the rest of the project.
4. prefixtopostifx.py = the file which has the main programming of transforming the stacks from postfix to prefix, if possible.
5. runtime_metric.py = the file which has the codings that contain proper runtimes that can be used for the code. 
6. out.txt = the file which contains 
7. ENanalysis.pdf = this wraps up and connects the project thorough analysis. Ideal to read first to capture the big picture in order to dive into each file. 


# Order of Operations to run this code
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
2. Follow [this website](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-use-google-colab-with-github-via-google-drive-68efb23a42d) to properly utilize google colab as a shell terminal, and save to drive for interconnectednes across devices.
3. The code should then be functionable.
4. **Optional, check out the entire source code here:**

 ### Motivation 
  The motivation for this project was to build data structures and algorithms skills, as well as dive into the computer science realm! 
  
 ### Architecting 

I built this project in order to grow my knowledge of programming. Also, I hope to provide enhancements that will reduce coding pain of the JHU community.

### Purpose

Efficiently (as possible) converts prefix to postfix. Ideally, all prefix would have been convertable. This was not possible in this project :(

### Lessons Learned

Sometimes programming does not go as planned. Perserve through the bugs and try to nail the solution. Keep in mind that you are coding for a purpose greater than yourself.

### Uniqueness

I put all of my energy into my programming. I did my best, and almost always do my best in every project I attempt. This project is no exception. Where there are errors, I will attempt to resolve them.

### Additional Features

My analysis is pretty thoughtful, in my opinion.

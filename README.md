### 

At Valparaiso University, I was fortunate enough to complete three distinct projects which provided me with a wealth of opportunities for growth and learning. These projects presented unique challenges and required the application of various skills, enabling me to further develop my abilities and knowledge. The hands-on experience and problem-solving skills I acquired through these projects have been instrumental in enhancing my overall expertise and preparing me for future endeavors.

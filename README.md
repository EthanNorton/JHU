# Description 
Hello, reader. Forecasted about three years of sulfur emissions (split into four quarters). We will look into forecasting future sulfur emissions. In total, this data is crucial to study due to future levels of emissions. If these levels are projected to worsen, then we should be mindful of that. -Built various models through SAS programming: Classical Decomposition, ARMA modeling. -Tested to discover the best model with: shapiro-wilk testing, white noise probability, holt winters exponential smoothing, QQ plot, as well as calculated SSE values.

# Order of Operations to run this code

Code is stored with Junta Callahan, or maybe not. He is kind of forgetful.
 
 ### Motivation 
 
The motivation for this project was to solve climate change biases!
  
 ### Architecting 

We completed this project to earn a good grade. We got 100/100.

### Purpose

Efficiently completes the project. We did this one in record time. Junta did all of the coding.

### Lessons Learned

Do not tell Junta "all you did was press some buttons." All hell will break loose.

### Uniqueness

Junta and I put together a solid project, that became applicable.

### Additional Features

We presented this pretty well, and covered the whole topic.

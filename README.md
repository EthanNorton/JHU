# Description 

Hello, reader. This is the README and will serve as a great way to access files that are utilized in given project.

# Navigation through this 

Input file names

# Additions of this Project 

1. Connected to Google colab
2. Incorporated globals into the coding.
3. Maximized postifx conversion through recursion.
4. Compacted code.
5. Tried to apply Quantum Algorithms.
6. Tried to figure out how google cloud fits into the picture. 

# Order of Operations to run this code

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
2. Follow [this website](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-use-google-colab-with-github-via-google-drive-68efb23a42d) to properly utilize google colab as a shell terminal, and save to drive for interconnectedness across devices.
 
 ### Motivation 
 
The motivation for any project is to grow skills in order to enhance something. 
  
 ### Architecting 

I had visions to architect future projects through the cloud! I am wishing to grow google scalability partners. 

### Purpose

Efficiently completes the project. This project when then be applied as it should be applicable to something. 

### Lessons Learned

Google cloud needs a lot of developing! I wish that there were more developed quantum algorithms that could efficiently recurse.
There was quite a learning curve here with respect to how I learned to save files in the google drive folders, to properly linking the files to github automatically.

### Uniqueness

This file focuses on recursion, especially with respect to implementing cloud computing, through google colab. 

### Additional Features

This project fiugred out how to link up google colab and github seamlessly.

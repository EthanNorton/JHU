# Navigation through this 

Input file names

# Additions of this Project 

1. Incorporated globals into the coding.
2. Connected to Google Cloud.
3. Maximized postifx conversion through recursion.
4. Compacted code.
5. Tried to apply Quantum Computing.

# Order of Operations to run this code

Insert dependent on given project.
 
 ### Motivation 
 
The motivation for any project is to grow skills in order to enhance something. 
  
 ### Architecting 

I had visions to architect future projects through the cloud! I am wishing to grow google scalability partners. 

### Purpose

Efficiently completes the project. This project when then be applied as it should be applicable to something. 

### Lessons Learned

Google cloud needs a lot of developing! I wish that there were more developed quantum algorithms that could efficiently recurse.
There was quite a learning curve here with respect, 

### Uniqueness

This file focuses on recursion, especially with respect to implementing cloud computing, through google colab. 

### Additional Features

This project fiugred out how to link up google colab and github seamlessly.

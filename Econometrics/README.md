# About

### -Discovered a statistically significant variable (through SAS) not used in modern literature. This interaction variable (meals together as a family *if a woman) is now prevalent in COVID-19! This was a publishable level paper, just was not peer-reviewed due to time constraints.
### -Collaborated with my professor in order to obtain these results. 
### -Acquired these results using V-look up in excel files.

# Navigation through this 

### Math - Done by Daniel Picolli
### Analysis and Lit Review - Mostly done by Ethan Norton (over like 3 years, but also 2 months). Some books were not mentioned in the sources.
## Graphs - Ethan did these in excel, and were modeled off of one of the quoted papers.


# Order of Operations to run this code

### The math is done by Daniel and depicted through Matlab. 
### The graphs were modeled similarly to a source, and then altered to fit the context of the problem in this problem.

 
 ### Motivation 
 
The motivation for this project was to solve climate change biases!
  
 ### Architecting 

We completed this project to earn a good grade. We got A-.

### Purpose

Efficiently completes the project. We did this one in record time. Pretty evenly spread workload.

### Lessons Learned

A little better understanding of mathmetical theorems. Daniel and I both did extremely poorly on final exam, but the theorems were not very intuitive in our defense (exams taken seperately).

### Uniqueness

This one also became relavent.

### Additional Features

Pretty straightforward project!

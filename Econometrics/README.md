# About

### -Discovered a statistically significant variable (through SAS) not used in modern literature. This interaction variable (meals together as a family *if a woman) is now prevalent in COVID-19! This was a publishable level paper, just was not peer-reviewed due to time constraints.
### -Collaborated with my professor in order to obtain these results. 
### -Acquired these results using V-look up in excel files.

# Navigation

### Coding - provided by Sedefka Beck's intensive coding in SAS on a huge dataset for her projects. I let her know my idea & she shared her dataset with me, which she guided along the process.
### Analysis and Lit Review - Mostly done by Ethan Norton. Some books were not mentioned in the sources.
### Graphs - I did these in SAS, which was my first coding language.
### Professor of class - Sara Gundersen.


# Order of Operations to run this code

### The programming language is SAS, and I did most of the coding. Professor Beck helped me debug, and Professor Gundersen taught the methods.
### The graphs were produced with my intuition.

 
 ### Motivation 
 
The driving force behind this project was to explore ways of becoming a more supportive and understanding spouse. The aim was to better understand the needs and desires of the partner, and to provide the necessary support and care in a relationship. The project was based on extensive research, self-reflection and introspection, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the bond and improving the overall satisfaction in the relationship. This effort was made with the intention of creating a happier and more fulfilling relationship, not only for oneself, but for the partner as well. The outcome of this project has the potential to provide valuable insights for couples seeking to strengthen their bond and improve their relationships.
  
 ### Architecting 

I enjoyed this class and course very much. It changed the trajectory of my life. I earned an A.

### Purpose

I wanted to become a robust economist, and learn how to think like an econometrician.

### Lessons Learned

Oh my gosh, this class led to many late nights and growth in my analytical capabilities. Well over 100 hours, including time spent brainstorming. This sharpened my brain in many aspects.

### Uniqueness

This one became relavent in COVID-19.

### Additional Features

I apologize for the difficulty in reading this. I delved deeply into this subject and made some intriguing findings.

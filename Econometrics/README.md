# About

### -Discovered a statistically significant variable (through SAS) not used in modern literature. This interaction variable (meals together as a family *if a woman) is now prevalent in COVID-19! This was a publishable level paper, just was not peer-reviewed due to time constraints.
### -Collaborated with my professor in order to obtain these results. 
### -Acquired these results using V-look up in excel files.

# Navigation

### Coding - provided by Sedefka Beck's intensive coding in SAS on a huge dataset for her projects. I let her know my idea & she shared her dataset with me, which she guided along the process.
### Analysis and Lit Review - Mostly done by Ethan Norton. 
### Graphs - I did these in SAS, which was my first coding language.
### Professor of class - Sara Gundersen.


# Order of Operations to run this code

### The programming language is SAS, and I did most of the coding. Professor Beck helped me debug, and Professor Gundersen taught the methods.
### The graphs were produced with my intuition.

 
 ### Motivation 
 
The driving force behind this project was to explore ways of becoming a more supportive and understanding spouse. The aim was to better understand the needs and desires of the partner, and to provide the necessary support and care in a relationship. The project was based on extensive research, self-reflection and introspection, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the bond and improving the overall satisfaction in the relationship. This effort was made with the intention of creating a happier and more fulfilling relationship, not only for oneself, but for the partner as well. The outcome of this project has the potential to provide valuable insights for couples seeking to strengthen their bond and improve their relationships.
  
 ### Architecting 

I enjoyed this class and course very much.  I earned an A.

### Purpose

The driving force behind this desire was to acquire a strong foundation in the principles of economics and to develop a deep understanding of the tools and techniques used by econometricians. I saw this as an opportunity to not only gain a comprehensive knowledge of the subject, but also to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential to success in this field. Through rigorous training, I hoped to be able to apply econometric methods to real-world problems and contribute to the advancement of this discipline. In short, I aimed to become an expert in econometrics, with the ability to think creatively, analyze data effectively, and make informed decisions.

### Lessons Learned

This class was a challenging yet enriching experience that allowed me to significantly develop my analytical skills. Through numerous late nights and countless hours of dedicated effort, including extensive brainstorming, I have acquired a deeper understanding and enhanced my abilities in the field. I am grateful for the lessons learned and growth achieved in this class.

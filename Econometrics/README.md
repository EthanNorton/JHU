# About

### -Discovered a statistically significant variable (through SAS) not used in modern literature. This interaction variable (meals together as a family *if a woman) is now prevalent in COVID-19! This was a publishable level paper, just was not peer-reviewed due to time constraints.
### -Collaborated with my professor in order to obtain these results. 
### -Acquired these results using V-look up in excel files.

# Navigation

### Coding - provided by Sedefka Beck's intensive coding in SAS on a huge dataset for her projects. I let her know my idea & she shared her dataset with me, which she guided along the process.
### Analysis and Lit Review - Mostly done by Ethan Norton (over like 3 years, but also 2 months). Some books were not mentioned in the sources.
### Graphs - I did these in SAS, which was my first coding language.
### Professor of class - Sara Gundersen


# Order of Operations to run this code

### The programming language is SAS, and I did most of the coding. Professor Beck helped me debug, and Professor Gundersen taught the methods.
### The graphs were produced with my intuition.

 
 ### Motivation 
 
The motivation for this project was to optimize how to husband!
  
 ### Architecting 

I enjoyed this class and course very much. It changed the tracjectory of my life. I earned an A.

### Purpose

I wanted to become a robust economist, and learn how to think like an econometrician.

### Lessons Learned

Oh my gosh, this class led to many late nights and headaches. Well over 100 hours, including time spent brainstorming. This sharpened my brain in many aspects!

### Uniqueness

This one also became relavent.

### Additional Features

This one is hard to read through, I apologize. I dived so deep into this one, but there were some interesting discoveries.

# About

An innovative method leveraging Nash bargaining solutions has been devised to examine energy consumption patterns, where energy companies engage in negotiations with consumers to determine acceptable energy levels.

Our findings indicate that a deficiency in cooperation could lead to elevated energy consumption during the summer months in 2050. Additionally, the ramifications of climate change on energy consumption are analyzed, revealing how the effects of climate change may foster cooperation between the parties to circumvent costly outcomes in the future.
# Navigation through this 

### Math - Done primarily by Daniel Picolli (Mathematics major).
### Analysis and Lit Review - Mostly done by Ethan Norton. Some books were not mentioned in the sources.
## Graphs - Ethan did these in excel, and were modeled off of one of the quoted papers.


# Order of Operations to run this code

### The mathematical coding was done by Daniel and depicted through Matlab. 
### The graphs were modeled similarly to a source, and then altered to fit the context of the problem in this problem.

 
 ### Motivation 
 
The objective behind this project was to address biases related to climate change, enhance analytical abilities, and integrate the outcomes of game theory studies into the class curriculum.
  
 ### Architecting 

We completed this project to earn a good grade. We got A-.

### Purpose

Efficiently completes the project. We did this one in record time. Pretty evenly spread workload.

### Lessons Learned

A little better understanding of mathmetical theorems. Daniel and I both did extremely poorly on final exam, but the theorems were not very intuitive in our defense (exams taken seperately).

### Uniqueness

This one also became relavent.

### Additional Features

Pretty straightforward project!

# About

An innovative method leveraging Nash bargaining solutions has been devised to examine energy consumption patterns, where energy companies engage in negotiations with consumers to determine acceptable energy levels.

Our findings indicate that a deficiency in cooperation could lead to elevated energy consumption during the summer months in 2050. Additionally, the ramifications of climate change on energy consumption are analyzed, revealing how the effects of climate change may foster cooperation between the parties to circumvent costly outcomes in the future.
# Navigation through this 

### Math - Done primarily by Daniel Picolli (Mathematics major).
### Analysis and Lit Review - Mostly done by Ethan Norton. Some books were not mentioned in the sources.
## Graphs - Ethan did these in excel, and were modeled off of one of the quoted papers.


# Order of Operations to run this code

### The mathematical coding was done by Daniel and depicted through Matlab. 
### The graphs were modeled similarly to a source, and then altered to fit the context of the problem in this problem.

 
 ### Motivation 
 
The objective behind this project was to address biases related to climate change, enhance analytical abilities, and integrate the outcomes of game theory studies into the class curriculum.
  
 ### Architecting 

We completed this project to earn a good grade. We got A-.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore a new and inventive method of studying energy consumption patterns through the lens of Nash bargaining solutions. This method involves negotiations between energy companies and consumers to establish mutually acceptable energy levels. Our research has uncovered that a lack of cooperation between the parties could result in increased energy consumption in 2050 during the summer months. Moreover, our analysis delves into the impact of climate change on energy consumption and shows how the consequences of a changing climate could motivate cooperation and prevent costly outcomes in the future.

### Lessons Learned

Innovative Method of Examining Energy Consumption Through Nash Bargaining Solutions, Importance of Cooperation in Energy Negotiations, and Analysis of Climate Change's Impact on Energy Consumption and its Potential to Promote Cooperation and Avoid Costly Outcomes.

### Uniqueness

 This project takes a groundbreaking approach to examining energy consumption patterns by utilizing Nash bargaining solutions. The negotiations between energy companies and consumers present a fresh perspective on establishing energy levels that are acceptable to both parties. Our findings showcase the importance of cooperation in this process, revealing how a lack of cooperation could lead to elevated energy consumption in 2050 during the summer months. Furthermore, our analysis dives deep into the impact of climate change on energy consumption, illuminating how its consequences could drive cooperation and avoid costly outcomes in the future.

# About

A method based on Nash bargaining solutions is developed to explore energy consumption, in which energy companies have to negotiate their allowable energy levels with consumers.

Based on the findings, a lack of incentive in cooperation will result in high summer month consumption levels in 2050. -Further, effects of climate change on energy consumption are presented and explains how climate change may encourage cooperation among the parties to avoid higher costs in the future.
# Navigation through this 

### Math - Done primarily by Daniel Picolli (Mathematics major).
### Analysis and Lit Review - Mostly done by Ethan Norton. Some books were not mentioned in the sources.
## Graphs - Ethan did these in excel, and were modeled off of one of the quoted papers.


# Order of Operations to run this code

### The mathematical coding was done by Daniel and depicted through Matlab. 
### The graphs were modeled similarly to a source, and then altered to fit the context of the problem in this problem.

 
 ### Motivation 
 
The objective behind this project was to address biases related to climate change, enhance analytical abilities, and integrate the outcomes of game theory studies into the class curriculum.
  
 ### Architecting 

We completed this project to earn a good grade. We got A-.

### Purpose

Efficiently completes the project. We did this one in record time. Pretty evenly spread workload.

### Lessons Learned

A little better understanding of mathmetical theorems. Daniel and I both did extremely poorly on final exam, but the theorems were not very intuitive in our defense (exams taken seperately).

### Uniqueness

This one also became relavent.

### Additional Features

Pretty straightforward project!
